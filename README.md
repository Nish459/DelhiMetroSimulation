# DelhiMetroSimulation

This project simulates the Delhi Metro system and calculates the average number of people waiting for the next train. The algorithm allows users to input various variables and observe the output to optimize these inputs. One of the key variables that can be optimized is the number of tokens available, which affects the waiting queue.

## Features

- Simulates the Delhi Metro system.
- Calculates the average number of people waiting for the next train.
- Allows user input to modify variables.
- Optimizes variables for improved efficiency.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Delhi Metro Simulation project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Nish459/delhi-metro-simulation.git`
2. Run the file `app.py`

## Usage

The simulation can be customized by modifying the input variables. These variables include:
- Number of tokens available
- Other relevant variables (e.g., number of trains, train frequency, station capacity)

To optimize the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Start with default values for the variables.
2. Observe the output, particularly the average number of people waiting for the next train.
3. Adjust the variables and rerun the simulation to see the effect on the output.
4. Continue fine-tuning the variables until an optimal configuration is achieved.
